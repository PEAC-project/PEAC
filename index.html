        <div data-aos="fade-right">    
        <h1 class="heading">My Process</h1>
      <p>Like all good thing, this project was years in the making. My journey through PEAC has introduced so many opportunities to challenge my thinking and explore the <a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/design-thinking">design thinking process</a></p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-left">    
        <h1 class="heading">Self-Discovery</h1>
      <p>I started with exploring my <b>passions</b>, <b>values</b>, and <b>motivations</b> to find a project worthy to pursue.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided to focus on the topic of <b>health hobbies</b>. I thought that I could make a quick Google Site that outlines the benefits of healthy hobbies and how to find them. However, that’s not what PEAC is about.</p>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-right">    
        <h1 class="heading">Empathize</h1>
      <p>In this phase, you work to fully <b>understand</b> your <b>user</b> (the person who you are trying to help).</p>

<p>I started by doing a lot of research. Here are my key findings:</p>
          <ul>
<li><b>20.25%</b> of people don’t have a hobby</li>

<li>Teens who don’t spend any time doing extracurricular activities are:
<ul><li><b>57%</b> more likely to <b>drop out</b> of high school</li>
<li><b>49%</b> more likely to <b>use drugs</b> during their high school years</li>
  <li><b>37%</b> more likely to <b>become teen parents</b> during their high school years</li>
<li><b>35%</b> more likely to <b>smoke cigarettes</b> during their high school years</li>
<li><b>27%</b> more likely to <b>get arrested</b> during their high school years</li>
</ul>
<li>Engaging in enjoyable leisurely activities:</li><ul>
<li>Lowers blood pressure</li>
<li>Lowers cholesterol</li>
<li>Lowers waist circumference</li>
<li>Lower body mass index</li>
<li><b>34%</b> less stressed and <b>18%</b> less sad during the activities</li></ul></ul>
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-left">
          <p>
            Then I organized the research into an infographic: 
          </p>
          <img src="InphographicV1.png">
        </div>
        <div data-aos="fade-right">
          <p><br><br>
Then I sent out a survey to collect information from my end-users. My key findings include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>100%</b> of participants <b>had healthy hobbies</b></li>
<li>They are <b>motivated</b> by positive influences, including <b>family</b> and <b>friends</b></li>
  <li>They care about their mental, physical, and future <b>health</b></li>
  
  </ul>
<p>However, I also found out that <b>100% of participants had unhealthy hobbies</b>.This is where my project shifted. I realized that healthy and unhealthy hobbies go hand in hand: limit one and the other increases.</p>
       </div>
                <div data-aos="fade-left">    
        <h1 class="heading">Define</h1>
      <p>In this phase, you work to <b>analyze your empathy</b> research and discover <b>what your problem really is</b>.</p>
                    <p>
            I started ny capitalizing on my survey. I created a user persona to demonstrate who my user is. This will help me create a user-centered solution.
          </p>
          <img src="userPersona.png">
                    <p class="sub">
            (my drawing representation is also spot on)
          </p>
              </div>
         <div data-aos="fade-right">
                  <p>Then I created my How Might We Question. This will be the problem I will try to solve:</p>
<p><b>HOW MIGHT WE…</b> Use teenagers’ influences to limit their unhealthy
hobbies to benefit their mental and physical health?</p>
<p>Then I made it better:</p>
<p><b>HOW MIGHT WE…</b> Use teenagers’ societal influences, and interests to limit their unhealthy hobbies to benefit their mental and physical health?</p>
         </div>
         <div data-aos="fade-left">    
        <h1 class="heading">Ideate</h1>
      <p>In this phase, you work to think of as <b>many possible solutions</b> to your problem as possible. You will choose one to move forward with.</p>
                    <p>
So, I started by <b>brainstorming</b>. Thinking about <b>absurd solutions</b>. <b>Out of the box ideation</b>. <b>Researching inside of the box</b>: what’s been done, did it work, and why? But I also needed to <b>focus on my user</b>. It didn’t go the best…
          </p>
              </div>
 <div data-aos="fade-right"> 
   <p>
     Using the best idea I had, I created a <b>story board</b>. There are 3 sections to my plan.
   </p>
   <img src="storyBoard.png">
   <h3>Sketch and Plan:</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Use paper</li>
<li>Plan out website</li>
<li>Select colours, font and layouts</li>
<li>Must appeal to teenagers</li>
<li>Gather feedback on design</li>
<li>Continue research</li>
<li>Think of possible solutions to the problem. <b>The website won’t do everything</b></li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Prototype And Create:</h3>
   <ul>
     <li>Create a working model of the website </li>
<li>There will be very little design/styling</li>
<li>Make sure the website works and solves my problem</li>
<li>Gather more feedback</li>
<li>Gather feedback on design</li>
<li>Begin on turning the prototype into a product</li>
   </ul>
      <h3>Add Add Add:</h3>
   <ul>
<li>Continue iterating on the website</li>
<li>Perfect the solution to the problem</li>
<li>Build a social media account to appeal to teenagers (advertising)</li>
   </ul>
  </div>
 <div data-aos="fade-left">    
        <h1 class="heading">Meeting with Mr. Lowery</h1>
      <p>I had a meeting with Mr. Lowery (the mastermind behind PEAC) to discuss my project. We agreed that my topic was <b>too broad</b> and would need narrowed down. So I decided to change my project to <b>screentime</b>.</p>
                    <p>
I could still use my previous research and user-planning because excess screentime usage is an unhealthy hobby. And to fix the problem, you can introduce healthy hobbies to do instead. But I would need to go back and <b>redo</b> some <b>design thinking phases</b>.
          </p>
              </div>
 <div data-aos="fade-right">
   <p>
     With my newfound topic, I decided that I would need to do a lot <b>more research</b>. Following that, I created an <b>infographic</b> to summarize my scrutiny.
   </p>
   <img src="infographic2.png">
   </div>

        <br><br>
   <h1 id="initiative" class="heading">My Initiative</h1>
        
<div data-aos="fade-left">
  <p>Sticking to my <b>website</b> idea, I will design a website to host my solution and deliver other necessary <b>information</b>, <b>resources</b>, and <b>interactive fun</b>.</p></div>

<div data-aos="fade-right">
   <p>The base of my solution consists of a <b>challenge</b>. You will be able to take this challenge over a <b>verity of time ranges</b>, such as 4 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, or 1 month.</p></div>

<div data-aos="fade-left">
   <p>The <b>rules</b> of the challenge haven’t been ironed out (they will undergo lots of testing). However, currently they consist of the following:</p></div>

<div data-aos="fade-right">
<ul>
<li>You cannot spend time on a screen 1 hour before going asleep or 30 minutes after waking up</li>
<li>You must try to challenge someone else to complete it with you (unless someone has challenged yo)</li>
<li>Your goal is to half your average screentime in the time range (the longer time ranges will have you gradually decrease screentime and possible quarter it)</li>
<li>Motivate each other to continue the challenge and beet it together! (or try to do better than your opponent)</li>
</ul></div>

<div data-aos="fade-left">
   <p>This challenge is designed to <b>promote healthy hobbies</b> (like not disrupting your sleep cycle) and explore a <b>healthier lifestyle</b>. After completing, you will feel better emotionally, mentally, and physically. You will be able to continue to <b>maintain a lower screentime</b> (even if it’s just 1 hour or 30 minutes less). Hopefully, you will challenge someone else and <b>spread your success!</b></p></div>

<div data-aos="fade-right">
   <p>The website will contain many <b>more features</b>. There will be a <b>printable certificate</b> on completion of the challenge as a reminder to their success and achievement. Additionally, after the challenge, their will be a <b>survey to gather feedback</b> and offer congratulations. I will provide offline activities in an <b>Activity Glossary</b>. These activities can range from 1 person to group fun and consist of leisure to active and group to competitive activities. The goal is to <b>introduce healthy hobbies</b> to do instead of going on your phone constantly. The Activity Glossary will be available on my website and as a <b>printable</b> (so you don’t need to use screentime to find something to do).</p></div>

<div data-aos="fade-left">
   <p>I also want to include <b>motivational stories</b> of users who have taken the challenge and created a healthier, happier self.</p></div>

<div data-aos="fade-right">
   <p>I know that everyone can benefit from a decreased screentime. <b>Will you take the step to a healthier lifestyle?</b></p></div>
